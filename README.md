# traffic_density_analysis

This project focuses on predicting traffic levels in a specific area using the YOLOv8 deep learning model and OpenCV. By training on a custom dataset, the model can accurately determine the density of traffic in real-time. Our research findings have been successfully published, showcasing the model's effectiveness.

Features
1.Utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection
2.Employs OpenCV for image processing
3.Custom dataset for training and validation
4.Real-time traffic prediction
