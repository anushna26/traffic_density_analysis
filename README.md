# traffic_density_analysis

This project focuses on predicting traffic levels in a specific area using the YOLOv8 deep learning model and OpenCV. By training on a custom dataset, the model can accurately determine the density of traffic in real-time. Our research findings have been successfully published, showcasing the model's effectiveness.

Features

1.Utilizes YOLOv8 for object detection

2.Employs OpenCV for image processing

3.Custom dataset for training and validation

4.Real-time traffic prediction
